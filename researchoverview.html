									<h4>Most modern cosmological simulations use an approximate theory of gravity.</h4>
                                    <p> This is Newton's theory, which describes gravitational interactions by an invisible force pulling anything with mass towards anything else with mass. This works pretty well in most situations we're used to on Earth, and actually in most situations in general. It begins to be a problem if you have something really huge (e.g. a black hole), or something tiny near something relatively huge (e.g. the precession of the perihelion of Mercury around the Sun), or when we consider really large distances. <br />In cosmology our whole game is really large distances. <br />

<!--                                    Einstein's theory of General Relativity describes gravity as a consequence of geometry, so objects move across the "surface" of spacetime, rather than being pulled by an invisible force. Turns out this works much better in those problematic situations. Einstein published his theory over 100 years ago and, so far, <em>all of its predictions have been totally correct</em> (as far as we can tell). <br />-->

                                    Einstein's theory of General Relativity is a much better description of gravity in these problematic situations.

                                    Newton's theory (and some extensions to it) is predominantly used in cosmology because it's much simpler. Current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations use a combination of a homogeneous, isotropic spacetime in General Relativity and Newtonian dynamics.
                                     Comparing what comes out of these simulations to observations means we can use them to test and improve our current best-fit cosmological model; the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model.<!-- These have taught us so much about how the Universe, and all the stuff in it, has evolved. -->  <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The instruments we use to observe the Universe are constantly being improved. This means our data are getting more and more precise. As our errorbars get smaller, we're starting to notice some peculiarities between what we see and what we expected to see, based on our cosmological model. One suggestion (among many) is that this could be because we're not using General Relativity <em>in full</em>.  <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Newtonian dynamics describes the nonlinear evolution of matter extremely well. But pairing this with a homogeneous, isotropic spacetime means that this spacetime is largely <em>unaffected</em> by this nonlinear evolution. Effects such as curvature and inhomogeneous expansion are not properly captured in these simulations. These will have a direct effect on our observations, since they both affect the path of light rays as they travel towards us. But, how large is this effect? Is it important as the precision of our observations improve? Could it already be having an effect on what we observe?<br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <b>Numerical relativity is a way to solve Einstein's equations <em>in full</em> on the computer, so we don't need to make <em>any</em> simplifying assumptions about the spacetime, or the interaction between the matter and that spacetime. I do large-scale cosmological simulations of nonlinear structure formation using numerical relativity. Simulations like this are extremely new, and were only done for the first time a few years ago. See the first ones <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvL.116y1301G/abstract">here</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvL.116y1302B/abstract">here</a>, and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhRvD..95f4028M/abstract">here</a>. <br/>
                                        
                                        Simulations without simplifying assumptions will allow us to fully quantify any and all of the general-relativistic effects we expect to see in upcoming precision cosmological data, and maybe in existing data too.</b><br/>
